# Introduction

**bigUML** is a web modeling tool designed to provide an interactive UML modeling experience within **VS Code**. As a VS Code extension, bigUML is currently in its early development stage, and its features, structure, and functionality may evolve over time.

This documentation aims to provide comprehensive technical insights into bigUML's development, including:

## Theoretical Aspects
